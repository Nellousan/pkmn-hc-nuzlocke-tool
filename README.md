# Pokemon save editing tool

## Motivations

There is a trend in nuzlocking recently where players allow cheating for tasks that would require
grinding(like leveling up, raising happiness, farming berries, etc).

This project is motivated by the fact that the current way of cheating is either via
cheat codes or save editing softwares such as PKHeX. These solutions works very well but are still
tedious to use and I wanted to make a tool that automates these tasks.

Also, for rom hack such as Inclement Emerald, there is no cheat codes available, and PKHeX works but 
the items are wrong(items are added to the rom hack hence the item IDs are different than vanilla 
emerald).

This project aims at providing a scriptable way to edit pokemon saves. This could also serve as a 
save patcher, used when a romhack update would break the past save for example.

## Planned features

- Scriptable save edition with lua scripts.
